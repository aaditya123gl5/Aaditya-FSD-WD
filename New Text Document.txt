Document ingestion:-
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    full_text = ""
    for page in doc:
        full_text += page.get_text()
    return full_text


Chunking and embedding:-
from openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(api_key="your-api-key")
chunk_vectors = [embeddings.embed(chunk) for chunk in chunks]



User interface with streamlit:-


import streamlit as st

st.title("ðŸ“„ Document Q&A System")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a document", type=["pdf", "md", "html"])
user_query = st.text_input("Ask a question:")

if uploaded_file and user_query:
    # Extract, chunk, embed, search, generate answer (pipeline code here)
    st.write("**Answer:** ...display answer here...")
    st.write("_Reference: page X, section Y_")
